copyright copy right 1898 1998 by frank G carpenter omaha jan 14 1898 the trans I 1 mississippi exposition which is to open there here in june will show a development wt of our western country which will be a surprise eur prise to the rest of the united states during the last two months I 1 have visited all the big cities between boston and denver and I 1 find more money and push in the west than ever before there is undoubtedly y a revival of business the hotels are full everywhere I 1 find it hard to get good accommodations on the sleeping cars and the army of commercial travelers la Is greater than ever before I 1 was told in st paul that the jobbers there had never done so much business as they we are now doing the chicago merchants are expecting a heavy spring trade and at omaha denver and kansas city I 1 have found the people alive and most of them making money the basis of the prosperity has been the big crops here in nebraska senator chas chan P F manderson tells me bushels of wheat were produced last year and the corn crop now on hand amounts to something lake bushels senator manderson says that the agricultural products of this state lost jast year will toot foot up something like BM or a capital value of per family in this he includes the fiack ing products of which there is an enormous amount in nebraska he tells me that the farmers are learning how to use uee their crops they do not ell their corn as they did in the past but manufacture it into park by feeding it so that they get a big prine price per bushel for it I 1 was told in denver that the banks bancs had more money than they knew what to do with senator manderson says that the bank deposits here in omaha will approximate and I 1 learn that a similar condition exists in minneapolis and st paul until within a few years the west has relied on its ita corn wheat and meat to pay the greater part of its expenses now the farmers are diversifying their krops an immense amount of money la Is going into sugar beets in nebraska utah and colorado there Is a great sugar beet factory at grand island and ax another iother at norfolk in this state which are producing thousands of tons of sugar every year claus has established immense factories in california and the sugar makers belleve believe the day will soon come when we will make out of beets the hundred million dollars of sugar which we now I 1 import from other countries I 1 am told that we have better land for raising such sugar than can be found in europe and that factories will soon be established in many parts of the united states the beet sugar industry will be shown at the exposition another industry which promises to be I 1 worth much to kansas and nebraska is the utilization of the pith of the corn stalk for various manufacturing purposes they are noy now making a pasteboard something like linoleum out of this pith it is used for other things and there are factories which make from it packing to be placed between the outer and inner walls of our war vessels this cornstalk pith sucks up water like a sponge it swells the moment the water touches it and a hole made by a cannon ball will be soon corked up by the swelling produced by the water flowing in I 1 I 1 found senator manderson at the general offices of the burlington railroad he is you know the counsel for this system west of the missouri river and he has I 1 do not know how many thousands of miles of road under him including connections with all great states state of the west he is thoroughly posted on the condition of the west and during the chat he gave me some striking figures showing the sta status t us of the trans mississippi region said he the people of the east do wyt not un der derf stand tand ps they have no conception of the extent of the western country nor of the we do here I 1 believe new york and boston are the most provincial cities of the united states and that our exposition will be an eye opener to the rest of the country think of it more than one fourth of all the people of the united states live west of the mississippi we have about twenty minion million people and we are by no means so poor as Is commonly supposed the assessed valuation of the property held by the trans sippi states aggregate more than six billion dollars this valuation Is not more than one fourth of the actual value so that we have all told real and personal property worth at least twenty billion dollars an average of one thousand dollars per capita we are fast becoming a great manufacturing section missouri kansas nebraska colorado utah california oregon and washington are rapidly growing as manufacturing states so that the products of our factories and mills now amount to more than a billion dollars a year your chief products are however agricultural are they not they are both agricultural and mineral but the agricultural far exceeds the mineral our corn crop Is annually worth over two hindered hun dered million dollars it exceeds the annual gold output of the world by a number of I 1 millions n T our wheat crop amounts to something something like bushels a e year and nd we make about worth of hay every year the packing interests are very large the center of the packing industry is moving westward omaha kansas city and st joseph now kill enormous quantities of live stock and new packing houses are being built here and also at st joseph As to minerals the west produces worth of gold and silver a year and its production of copper and other minerals amounts to more than i that sum why some of tha mhd richest coal fields of the country are in the west colorado claims to have more coal than pennsylvania there is coal in montana and utah and we produce now something like ton annually in the trans mississippi states we have good iron and there will be great manufacturing centers in some of the western sections in the future how about the mortgages senator I 1 A great rry many of the farm mortgages have already been paid off and another year or so of good crops will put nebraska and kansas square with the world the terrified banker of the east need not be afraid of the west our people will pay all that they owe and if the present condition continues we will soon be sending money east to loan this is the granary of ammerita Ai Am merica and as long as the people of the fast east want to keep themselves fat they must pay us for our corn wheat and meat we have in texas the greatest of the cotton producing states we produce more than half the cotton I 1 think every year and we will always i be furnishing the rest of the united states with clothes for our woolen product is equally large we will always furnish the money in the shape of precious metals and I 1 dont see how it is possible for us to be otherwise than extremely prosperous in times thaes to come leaving senator manderson I 1 next called at the headquarters headquarter of the trana mississippi exposition and had a chat with J B haynes one of the secretaries as to the progress of the work with mr haynes I 1 took a street car ride out to the exposition grounds and made some photographs of the buildings as they are now in process of erection erect ten fon the cite of the exposition ta js w within it thin the city limits the ride to it ft from the center of the city takes about ten minutes the grounds are upon a broad plateau lying along the missouri river so that you see the buildings Ms as you come in on the railroads there are something like acres ir in the exposition grounds proper with axt ad a d dit ional territory on the opposite side of the road one of the most beautiful features of the grounds to is a wide lagoon running through them from fro m one end to the other this has been made by excavating cava ting the earth and waning walling the sides of the pit with boards the lagoon as I 1 judge about feet wide at one end and less than this at the other it was covered wath ice during our vig it and hundreds of boys and girls were skating to and fro upon it the boarded walls are to be hidden by staff so that they will look like marble wid and ornamented with electric lights trans fromang it into a beautiful waterway upon which gondolas canoes and other othe boats of various kinds will div from one building to another at the eastern end of the canal the ground will be built up in terraces adorned with shrub shrubbery bery and flowers ending in a great stairway crowned by a kiosk th there ere wt will be a number of grottoes built b ut it here lighted with electric lights I 1 in n w which ht the blue grotto of capri and marn mammoth th cave will be reproduced along this canal or lagoon la aroon gal all the main buildings axe are located many of these are almost completed the manufactures buildings Is still a forest of rafters and other kinds of lumber the framework however is up as high as an the roof and a portion of the root roof 7 has already been put on there were perhaps a hundred carpenters at work on it during my stay and the sound of the hammer was to be heard in every part of the grounds this building covers several acres it will when finished look very much like one of the chicago worlds fair buildings and will be finished in the same way the agricultural building is almost competed and all of the buildings with the exception of the government building are well under way there are I 1 judge at least half a dozen great structures already ready for ro roofing fing and I 1 am told that the work will be rapidly pushed in the spring the government building for which congress has appropriated Is by no menas far advanced the foundation has been dug but little more more than this can be done before spring this build ing will be at the head bead of the it will cover about three fourths of an acre and will be a beautiful structure of the ionic style it will have a dome which will be capped by a figure representing liberty enlightening the world the figure will be lighted by electricity and the torch in the hand of the statue will be feet above the ground near this is the fine art building already half completed mr haynes tells me that the exhibition of american pictures will be very large and that many of the finest paintings owned in the west will be loaned to the exposition there are some choice art collections in st paul denver st louis kansas city and omaha and many pictures which have never been shown to the public will be here exhibited choice pictures have been loaned by the chicago art museum the detroit art museum the st louis art museum and the art galleries of other cities mr haynes tells me that one of the directors will scour europe for the purpose of having a good representation of foreign art and that the best foreign artists will be asked to send specimens of their work I 1 am told that all the states west of the mississippi will participate in the show state buildings are already going up in the part of the exposition grounds which lie opposite the park occupied aupied by the main buildings the nebraska building is already finished and other buildings we are about to be erected by illinois iowa montana colorado wisconsin utah and south dakota the illinois building with its exhibits will cost and of this will go 0 into the building itself the plans ave have already been made and the structure is a combination of greek and byzantine architecture with a dome on the top illinois has engaged already about square feet of space it will have a large agricultural exhibit and also the biggest exhibit of foreign implements clements ts and manufactures that the state has ever shown in any exposition attempts A will be made during the next session of the iowa legislature to add 60 to its app appropriation privation for the exposition the wisconsin building has already been planned and it will be under way before spring wyoming expects to spend something like on ner her exhibit and colorado in addition to a large amount of spacer already given in the various buildings will have EL a structure of its own both the dakotas have made appropriations for exhibits and montana has a fund half of which was subscribed by the state legislature and the ether half by marcus daly the millionaire copper miner california will show what that state is doing in fruit raising and mining louisiana has about an acre of space in the agricultural building to show its products and texas expects to give a bl b exhibit of its resources applications for space 1 1 I am told are coming in very rapidly from private parties manufacturers and commercial firms from all parts of the united states and the indications are that the exposition will have a good representation of the industries of the whole country among the curious features of the exhibition will be a representation of our american indians indiana the idea is to have the government send here fifteen indians of each tribe and to have each tribe have its own little camp or indian village so that by walking through this exhibit one can get a knowledge of the indians of the united states these indians will have their feast days they will go through their various games and the show will be both instructive and interesting such i a thing has never been attempted in any other exhibition it will probably be carried on by the government and will form a part of the general sh show so that there will be no extra chai charge ge the nearness of many of the reservations to omaha will make this part of afi the exhibition exhibition cost comparatively little at the same time the government will probably send its wonderful collection ua Bre pui am klapow sia jo fo in their various occupations which may mav form a part of this special exhibit among the other queer things to be shown will be daniel boones cabin this will be brought from missouri and will be rebuilt here after boone left kentucky he moved to missouri and there spent his last days there will bip be a representation of the egyptians of the soudan and other shows something after the fashion of the midway plaisance of chicago A day in the alps will be the title of a department showing life in switzerland this will be made up of real people of paintings and of scenic effects built u to represent the reality the alps and their glaciers the tourists climbing the mountains ete etc will all be shown then there willae will te t e shows depicting life in the west of the dime novel description or of the buffalo bill order shows containing indian massacres such as a reenactment of the ouster custer massacre of 1877 and other scenes of scouting life as they formerly took place in the west A reprise representation rep rese tation of mining at cripple creek will be given depicting life in the min mining ing camps and also other queer features such as the sherman umbrella in which passengers axe are sent flying around a circle in a car which a raised to a height of feet above the earth FRANK G CARPENTER"

View from the west side of the southern transept showing entrances to the eastern transept chapels. There is also a partial view of the northern respond of the transept arcade showing a moulded bell capital carried on a cylindrical pier with water-holding base. The eastern elevation of the transept shows a sexfoil window in spandrel between the pointed chamfered arched entrances to the chapels. They have double lancet windows framed by arches with dogtooth ornament and roll mouldings resting on bell capitals and bonded shafts. The chapels are linked by a pointed chamfered arch and the southern-most chapel has a round headed window in the southern elevation."
